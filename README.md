# Movie Success - What does it rely on?

This project is a hypothetical scenario in which I (Jacob Lloyd) have been hired to produce a MySQL database on movies from a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset. I will use this data to analyze what makes a movie successful and provide recommendations based on the findings.
 
## Data Acquisition/Initial Analysis

- Gather IMDB Movie Data according to stakeholder requirements - see IMDB-ETL.ipynb
- Gather financials for IMDB movies using TMDB's API - see TMDB-ETL.ipynb
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis according to stakeholders interests - see EDA.ipynb

## The Coding Dojo
This hypothetical scenario was provided by The Coding Dojo's amazing Data Science (Part Time) bootcamp. It was completed by myself as a project to show my Data Science capabilities.
